# OS_threads
Operating systems

In this mini-project I implemented a multiprocess filesystem search program.

The implementation includes important multithreading concepts such as parallel programing, 
locks (mutex and condition variables) and signals. 
In addition, I learned about filesystem system calls such as opendir, readdir and stat,
using them in my implementation.

The program searches a directory tree for files whose name matches some search term.
The program receives a directory D and a search term T, and finds every file
in Dâ€™s directory tree whose name contains T. The program parallelizes its work using threads.
Specifically, individual directories are searched by different threads.

Run this to compile:
gcc -O3 -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809 -Wall -std=c11 -pthread pfind.c

Command line arguments:
1. Search root directory (search for files within this directory and its subdirectories).
2. Search term (search for file names that include the search term).
3. Number of searching threads (assumes a valid integer greater than 0).
